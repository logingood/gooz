# Description

Go version of Zendesk Coding Challenge, code name GOOZ.

To build cli we have used [spf13 cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)

* Search is organized using basic hash table on maps
* Results are printed as tables, for short version use `--relaed=fasle` flag. Otherwise for all related items tables will be printed as well.
* Hash table takes interface{} as input
* Search module attempts to detect types and makes everything `string`
* Table module draw tables and also detects type
* We validate input against provided schema for safety reasons
* We use [sync.RWMutex](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#RWMutex) to ensure thread
  safety, however this tool is single threaded. No guarantee if it works
  correctly for parallel execution because we use [golang
  maps](https://blog.golang.org/go-maps-in-action). See concurrency section.

# Challenge check list

- [x] Separation of concerns: every module is implemented as independent package (e.g. `index`, `search`, `table`, `cli`, `backend` and etc)
- [x] Simplicity: we used the most basic type of data structure - hash table and list to organize search index
- [x] Test coverage: every module is tested separately, a test coverage report is provided. We haven't tested cobra cli because it comes from the library.
- [x] Performance analysis is provided. For large subsets 13.79 lookups/ms performance should be expected.
- [x] Errors are handled and logged, corresponding tests provided

# Install and build

You can use `go get` command:

```
go get -u github.com/logingood/gooz
```

Alternatively use [Docker](https://github.com/logingood/gooz#dockerfile) or build yourself:
```
git clone https://github.com/logingood/gooz
cd gooz
go run . --help
```

# CLI and Configuration

By default `gooz` will look for tables in `./data/tickets.json`, `./data/users.json` and `./data/organizations.json`.
To alter this you can use `--organizations_path`, `--tickets_path` and `--users_path` flags and supply to cli.

Search tickets by any field, e.g. subject

```
gooz tickets subject "A Problem in South Africa"
```

For short output you can use flag `--related=false`, it is true by default and prints all related informationt to found items
```
gooz users suspended true --related=false
```

Search organization by any field, e.g.

```
gooz organizations created_at  "2016-05-21T11:10:28 -10:00"
```

Search users by any field
```
gooz users alias "Miss Rosanna"`
```

Search by empty field, just use ""

```
gooz tickets assignee_id ""
```

Check all availabel options and configuration keys with

```
gooz help
```

```
Usage:
  gooz [command]

Available Commands:
  help          Help about any command
  organizations Search organizations table
  tickets       Tickets search
  users         search users table

Flags:
      --config string               config file (default is $HOME/.gooz.yaml)
  -h, --help                        help for gooz
      --organizations_path string   path to your organizations.json, default is data/organizations.json (default "data/organizations.json")
      --tickets_path string         path to your tickets.json, default is data/tickets.json (default "data/tickets.json")
      --users_path string           path to your users.json, default is data/users.json (default "data/users.json")
```

# Dockerfile

One of the easiest ways to build and run the code is a docker command

```
git clone https://github.com/logingood/gooz
cd gooz

docker build . -t gooz
```

Run the container
```
docker rm -f gooz >/dev/null 2>&1;  docker run -ti --name gooz gooz:latest /bin/gooz --help
```


# Pluggable backend

Backend implements interface `Store`, you need to implement three methods in order to use interface.
At the moment only Filesystem with json files is implemented as per the task, however you can replace it
with other backends that implements similar interface without requirement to rewrite whole code.
E.g. using sqlx with sqlite/mysql and etc.

```

# Performance

You can use generator flag to generate perfdata, e.g.
```
gooz generate --size 100
```

By default it will create files 100K records each in `perfdata/` directory. 100K of users, organizations and tickets. The size of the each file is around ~30MB.
Let's assume that we search a bool flag e.g. true/false and say it takes true value for everything. Hence we need to iterate through the list of 100K records. Then for the each ID we search of organizations and tickets. If it is a user search we are going to run 2 lookups per user (lookup assignee_id and submitter_id) + building indexes. It should be around 100K + 100K(OrgID) + 100K(assignee_id) + 100K(submitter_id) ~ 400K lookups, it takes around 30s.

Lookup rate  400K/29s = 13.79 lookups/ms.

```
time go run . users role agent --related=false --organizations_path perfdata/organizations.json --tickets_path perfdata/tickets.json --users_path perfdata/users.json >/dev/null
go run . users role agent --related=false --organizations_path  --tickets_pat  30.60s user 17.50s system 143% cpu 33.515 total

```

For 10K records, lookup rate would be 13 lookups/ms

```
time go run . users role agent --related=false --organizations_path perfdata/organizations.json --tickets_path perfdata/tickets.json --users_path perfdata/users.json >/dev/null
go run . users role agent --related=false --organizations_path  --tickets_pat  3.66s user 1.96s system 149% cpu 3.754 total
<Paste>
```

For thousand records (each file 1000 records) we have time 1.13s. Files are 290K each. Lookup rate 3.5 records/ms.

```
time go run . users role agent --related=false --organizations_path perfdata/organizations.json --tickets_path perfdata/tickets.json --users_path perfdata/users.json >/dev/null
go run . users role agent --related=false --organizations_path  --tickets_pat  1.13s user 0.49s system 153% cpu 1.055 total
```

That is interesting that we can lookup faster if saerch 100K records files because we are building Indexes for invokation of the CLI. Hence for bigger amount of records we see better performance as it takes some time to build
the hash table.

Adding concurrency and statically typing everything can give extra perormance, however here we have used `map[string]interface{}`.
